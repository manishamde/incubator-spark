This package contains the default implementation of the decision tree algorithm.

The decision tree algorithm supports:
+ information loss calculation with entropy and gini for classification and variance for regression
+ node model pruning
+ printing to dot files
+ unit tests

#Performance testing

#Future Extensions

+ Random forests
+ Boosting
+ Extremely randomized trees
